# OcuTool
OcuTool is a simpler version of the Oculus Debug Tool. Currently you can use OcuTool to quickly swap values, as an alternative to the debug tool. 

OcuTool works by modifying the same registry values that the Debug Tool modifies. This means that you don't need to keep OcuTool open, and there won't be any conflicts between the settings in the Debug Tool and OcuTool.

This program is entirely standalone, if you want to uninstall it just delete the .exe file.
